// original materials and recipe that I will be following 

materials:
	plov:
		1 kg lamb or beef 
		1 kg rice
		vedgetable oil, sunflower if available 
		2 yellow onions 
		5 carrots 
		1-2 packets of plov seasoning
		1 head of garlic
		salt to taste 
	side salad:
		3 beef tomatoes
		1 sweet yellow onion 
		salt and pepper to taste  


directions:
	plov:
		1. wash and cut lamb/beef into bite sized pieces
		2. wash your rice thoroughly, place it in a bowl and cover it with salted water - leave for 30 minutes 
		3. in a kazan, or a pot with a thick bottom, heat up a couple tablespoons of vedgetable oil 
		4. clean and cut onions into thin slices 
		5. clean, peel, and julienne carrots into very thin slices 
		6. add in the meat to the hot oil and fry it off 10-15 mins, until it is brown on every side
		7. add in the onion and carrots and cook off for 10-15 mins 
		8. add in the rice and enough salted water so that the water level is 2cm above the rice level 
		9. DO NOT MIX THE RICE ONCE WATER IS ADDED - the meat should remain on the bottom with the veggies, the rice may toast a bit 
		10. add in the whole head of garlic, cut the top off so the cloves are exposed 
		11. add in the plov spice packet
		12. cover with a lid and allow it to cool 15-20 mins on a small flame, until the water has fully evaporated, the rice should be cooked, but not sticky 
		13. turn off heat and cover pot cover with towel to allow plov to sit for an extra 10 minutes, this will allow the flavors to meld together 
		14. mix right before serving - or putting away
