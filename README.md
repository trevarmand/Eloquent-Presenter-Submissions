# Baja Fish Tacos
Today I will be teaching you all how to make beer battered fish tacos. Also known as Baja
fish tacos, these tacos are very popular in Mexico and southern California, specifically
San Diego where I am from. This type of taco holds a very special place in my heart since
I grew up eating them and still love them to this day. They are light, flavorful, and
crunchy. They are truly a San Diego staple.
